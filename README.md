## Usage

Horiseon's website educates users on how to run a company by managing their online website. SEO, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing are all important in any company's growth. 

## Credits

Classmates Daniel (https://github.com/drog41813), Lucas (https://github.com/LucasWyski001), and Mika (https://github.com/micavilla) helped me shorten my code tremendously by showing me how to use this, .find and .each in my code.

 Originally I was going to set an ID for each time, and then have a variable for each time in my js file. With that variable, I would use the ID and that ID would be used for the save function to local storage, as well as color changing.
