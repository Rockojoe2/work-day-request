# work-day-request

## Description

The planner lets you save your things that you need to remember and saves it to the local storage. It is color coded to have grey boxes when the hour has passed, green when the hours haven't happened yet, and red when it is the current hour.

## Credits

Classmates Daniel (https://github.com/drog41813), Lucas (https://github.com/LucasWyski001), and Mika (https://github.com/micavilla) helped me shorten my code tremendously by showing me how to use this, .find and .each in my code.

 Originally I was going to set an ID for each time, and then have a variable for each time in my js file. With that variable, I would use the ID and that ID would be used for the save function to local storage, as well as color changing.

 UTA class files also helped with this project.
